# Custom examples for "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four
### Note: self-educational project in process

This repo holds custom usage examples for the OOP patterns described in the book mentioned above. 
Each case bears complete documentation of the usage case, reference to the original catalogue 
and descriptive commentary on the behaviour of the entities.
While being a self-educational project with no planned audience, 
it may help one to build a better understanding of the OOP patterns.
